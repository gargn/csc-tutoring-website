Cal Poly's Computer Science Department offers tutoring, free of charge, for all students taking CSC courses. We offer help on all scheduled evenings for students in CSC/CPE 101, 102, 103, or 141. Depending on the tutors on duty, we may also offer help on certain evenings for other CSC courses, including 234, 349, and 357.
