          <h3>Nupur Garg</h3>
          <p><em>Currently the head tutor.</em></p>
          <p>My name is Nupur and I am a second year software engineering major. I fell in love with programming after taking a Lego robotics summer class during middle school and my passion for the field has continued to grow ever since. I enjoy exploring the different disciplines within computer science and have held internships in mobile development, web development and networks. Most recently, I spent my summer at Symantec learning networks and improving performance on automation scripts. Outside of computer science, I religiously watch Ellen and Modern Family, and I love trying new ethnic (and vegetarian) cuisines.<p></p>

	    <p>I'm a undergraduate student majoring in computer science. I became interested in computer science my sophomore year of high school when I took a couple of introductory programming classes. While I'm still exploring my interests in computer science, I am currently looking into operating systems and compilers. When I have free time, I like to play my ukulele and enjoy the outdoors. </p>

	  <p>Hi, my name’s Katelyn and I am a second year majoring in Software Engineering. I grew up in Bakersfield, CA and did not have any programming experience prior to Cal Poly, but I could not have chosen a better major. I have a passion for graphics and I look forward to gaining more experience in that area this summer at Apple. When I’m not programming, it's not odd to see me consuming a large amount of coffee, exploring the beautiful central coast and great hiking trails around SLO, or doodling on spare pieces of paper.</p>

I have discovered a passion for education through my travels and am now working toward a master's degree to teach high school in the future. When I'm not on campus I enjoy spending my time most with my wife and our newborn son.</p>

          <p>Hi, I’m Jasper Kahn and I’m a first year Computer Science major from San Jose, California. I started programming through a survey of computer science course at my high school, and decided it was for me after an internship with my dad’s startup. I like the problem solving and creative power of programming, and being involved in new technology. Last summer I worked for a startup developing mobile apps for trade shows and other events. For fun, I read mysteries and sci-fi, play Xbox, and browse reddit.</p>

          <p>Hi, my name is Lana and I'm a fourth year Computer Science major starting the 4+1 program. I became interested in Computer Science through my father who taught me how to program a little turtle to move across the screen and then convinced me to take a class in high school. Since then I have been in love with programming. Aside from programming, I am a part of the Cal Poly Symphony, enjoy being active by spending time outside hiking or biking. </p>

          <p>I am an undergrad Software Engineering from a little town called Colfax. I originally came to Poly as an Art and Design Major, but my love for technical fields led me to make the switch into the College of Engineering. I found my home in SE because of its application through almost any industry, which allows me to go wherever my interests take me. I am currently interested in getting into fields involving security or aerospace application of software, while exploring some UX development on the side. Outside of coding, I still hold onto my old passions of art and photography, and often take to exploring the outdoors and rock climbing any chance I get.</p>

          <p>I'm Michelle, and I'm a 2nd year CS student from Sacramento, CA. I came into Cal Poly with no programming knowledge, but I've (hopefully and) quickly caught up! I am a giant foodie, and I've been using my internships in the major to gauge the quality of food at different tech hubs (so far, San Diego has some bomb adobada tacos, and the soon-to-be Bay Area provides some promising and long-lost Asian food back to my palate.) My area of interest is in computer security, and I look forward to exploring that in the near future!</p>
