   <h2>Nupur Garg</h2>
   <p>My name is Nupur and I am a fourth year computer science 4+1 student. I
   fell in love with programming after taking a Lego robotics summer class
   during middle school and my passion for the field has continued to grow ever
   since. I enjoy exploring the different disciplines within computer science
   and have held internships in mobile development, web development and
   networks. Outside of computer science, I religiously watch Ellen and Modern
   Family, and I love trying new ethnic (and vegetarian) cuisines.</p>

   <h2>Melinda Lam</h2>
   <p>I'm a undergraduate student majoring in computer science. I became
   interested in computer science my sophomore year of high school when I took
   a couple of introductory programming classes. While I'm still exploring my
   interests in computer science, I am currently looking into operating systems
   and compilers. When I have free time, I like to play my ukulele and enjoy
   the outdoors.</p>

   <h2>Katelyn Hicks</h2>
   <p>Hi, my name’s Katelyn and I am a fourth year majoring in Computer
   Science. I grew up in Bakersfield, CA and did not have any programming
   experience prior to Cal Poly, but I could not have chosen a better major. I
   have a passion for graphics and I look forward to gaining more experience in
   that area this summer at Apple. When I’m not programming, it's not odd to
   see me consuming a large amount of coffee, exploring the beautiful central
   coast and great hiking trails around SLO, or doodling on spare pieces of
   paper.</p>

   <h2>Daniel Kauffman</h2>
   <p>I'm a computer science graduate student from San Francisco. I have a BA
   in Linguistics from UC Berkeley and have worked as a language lab technician
   at an international school in London and as an elementary school English
   teacher in Japan. I have discovered a passion for education through my
   travels and am now working toward a master's degree to teach high school in
   the future. When I'm not on campus I enjoy spending my time most with my
   wife and our newborn son.</p>

   <h2>Jasper Kahn</h2>
   <p>Hi, I’m Jasper Kahn and I’m a second year Computer Science major from San
   Jose, California. I started programming through a survey of computer science
   course at my high school, and decided it was for me after an internship with
   my dad’s startup. I like the problem solving and creative power of
   programming, and being involved in new technology. Last summer I worked for
   a startup developing mobile apps for trade shows and other events. For fun,
   I read mysteries and sci-fi, play Xbox, and browse reddit.</p>

   <h2>Lana Hodzic</h2>
   <p>Hi, my name is Lana and I'm a fifth year Computer Science major in the
   4+1 program. I became interested in Computer Science through my father who
   taught me how to program a little turtle to move across the screen and then
   convinced me to take a class in high school. Since then I have been in love
   with programming. Aside from programming, I am a part of the Cal Poly
   Symphony, enjoy being active by spending time outside hiking or biking.</p>

   <h2>Brian Jones</h2>
   <p>Hi, I’m a mathematics graduate student and computer science minor. I
   started with computer science my 2nd year at Cal Poly and really enjoyed it.
   I really enjoy the more theoretical side of programming, namely algorithms
   and programming language theory. In my spare time I tend to be drinking
   coffee.</p>

   <h2>Kendall Gassner</h2>
   <p>Hi, I am a third year computer science major from Sacramento! I began
   programming my senior year of high school and haven’t stopped since. I have
   always been fascinated with complicated puzzles. Computer science is a way
   to utilize my interest in problem solving and create something practical. I
   am currently programming for MINDBODY, and could not be happier. My other
   interests include painting and tennis.</p>

   <h2>Dylan Howell</h2>
   <p>I am an undergrad Software Engineering from a little town called Colfax.
   I originally came to Poly as an Art and Design Major, but my love for
   technical fields led me to make the switch into the College of Engineering.
   I found my home in CS because of its application through almost any
   industry, which allows me to go wherever my interests take me. I am
   currently interested in getting into fields involving security or aerospace
   application of software, while exploring some UX development on the side.
   Outside of coding, I still hold onto my old passions of art and photography,
   and often take to exploring the outdoors and rock climbing any chance I
   get.</p>

   <h2>Michelle Lam</h2>
   <p>I'm Michelle, and I'm a 3rd year CS student from Sacramento, CA. I came
   into Cal Poly with no programming knowledge, but I've (hopefully and)
   quickly caught up! I am a giant foodie, and I've been using my internships
   in the major to gauge the quality of food at different tech hubs (so far,
   San Diego has some bomb adobada tacos, and the soon-to-be Bay Area provides
   some promising and long-lost Asian food back to my palate.) My area of
   interest is in computer security, and I look forward to exploring that in
   the near future!</p>
